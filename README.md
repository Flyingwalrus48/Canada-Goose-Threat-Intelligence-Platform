# Canada-Goose-Threat-Intelligence-Platform
A prototype strategic intelligence and travel risk platform developed as a case study for Canada Goose. Ingests and analyzes OSINT to provide actionable threat assessments
Canada Goose: Strategic Threat Intelligence Platform (Case Study)
1. Project Purpose
This is a functional prototype of a bespoke Global Security Threat Intelligence & Travel Risk Platform, developed as a strategic case study for the Global Security Intelligence & Travel Risk Analyst position at Canada Goose.

This platform is not intended to replace existing enterprise solutions but to serve as a tangible demonstration of my end-to-end analytical process. It proves my ability to translate raw data into predictive intelligence that directly supports business objectives.

2. Core Intelligence Focus
Based on a thorough analysis of Canada Goose's SEC filings, this platform is focused on monitoring and mitigating two of the company's most acute and unique threat vectors:

Activist Threat to Supply Chain Integrity: Following the company's 2022 fur-free pivot, the activist threat has evolved. The platform models this shift, focusing on the new battleground: the ethics and security of the global down supply chain.

Geopolitical Risk in Key Markets: The system monitors for leading indicators of consumer backlash in the critical Greater China market, allowing for proactive brand posture adjustments in response to geopolitical tensions.

3. Key Features & Demonstrated Capabilities
This project directly demonstrates my ability to perform the core functions outlined in the job description:

Intelligence Analysis & Threat Monitoring:

The platform features a Predictive Indicators & Warnings (I&W) Tracker that moves beyond reactive alerts to provide early warning of developing crises.

It contains a Threat Actor Database profiling groups like LAV and PETA, tracking their TTPs and strategic objectives.

Travel Risk Management & Contingency Planning:

The Automated Travel Risk Brief Generator creates tailored briefs for any of the 74 global retail cities.

For high-risk travel (e.g., a sourcing manager visiting European suppliers), the system automatically inserts Counter-Surveillance Protocols and "sterile itinerary" recommendations to protect personnel and sensitive supply chain information.

Internal Communication:

The dashboard serves as a model for the clear, concise dissemination of intelligence to senior leadership, visually linking security threats to specific business assets and regions.
