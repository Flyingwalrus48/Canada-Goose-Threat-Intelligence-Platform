• Diplomatic tension correlation with business impact assessment
• Trade policy change notifications with revenue risk calculations
• Government relations threat indicators and escalation protocols

TRAVEL RISK ASSESSMENT ENGINE:
Comprehensive travel security analysis for all 74 global retail locations:

• Executive protection protocols for supply chain personnel
• Counter-surveillance recommendations for Milan and Romania travel
• Emergency Action Plan integration (Medical Evacuation, Shelter-in-Place, Political Unrest)
• Secure transportation and accommodation vetting logic

INDICATORS & WARNINGS (I&W) FRAMEWORK:
Professional intelligence methodology implementing standard I&W protocols:

• Supply Chain Surveillance Detection (Current Status: YELLOW)
• RDS Certification Challenge Monitoring (Current Status: YELLOW)
• Milan Operational Activity Assessment (Current Status: YELLOW)
• Romania Facility Interest Tracking (Current Status: GREEN)
• Executive Targeting Indicators (Current Status: YELLOW)

INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS METHODOLOGIES

THREAT EVOLUTION ANALYSIS:
The system identifies and models the strategic shift in activist tactics following Canada Goose's 2022 fur-free commitment:

Previous Target: Fur use and animal welfare protests
Current Target: Down supply chain investigation and RDS certification credibility
New Vulnerabilities: Supply chain transparency gaps, executive travel exposure, facility location security

MONCLER PRECEDENT MODELING:
Comprehensive analysis of LAV's successful campaign against Moncler (2018-2022):

• Campaign Timeline: 3-4 year duration from initial pressure to policy victory
• Tactical Progression: Public awareness → Corporate engagement → Media pressure → Policy change
• Success Factors: Local presence, professional execution, strategic timing, international coordination
• Adaptation for Canada Goose: Target shift from fur to down, investigation vs protest tactics

COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE PROTOCOLS:
Advanced threat assessment for executive and supply chain personnel:

• Surveillance Detection Training requirements for Milan travel
• Alternative meeting location protocols for supplier engagements
• Secure communication procedures for sensitive business discussions
• Emergency evacuation and extraction procedures for high-risk locations

DEMONSTRATED BUSINESS IMPACT

RISK MITIGATION VALUE:
• Early warning system preventing reactive crisis management
• Executive protection enhancement reducing travel-related security incidents
• Supply chain vulnerability identification preventing operational disruptions
• Reputation protection through proactive threat assessment and response

COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS:
• Prevention of single major security incident justifies entire system development cost

A prototype strategic intelligence and travel risk platform developed as a case study for Canada Goose. Ingests and analyzes OSINT to provide actionable threat assessments
Canada Goose: Strategic Threat Intelligence Platform (Case Study)
1. Project Purpose
This is a functional prototype of a bespoke Global Security Threat Intelligence & Travel Risk Platform, developed as a strategic case study for the Global Security Intelligence & Travel Risk Analyst position at Canada Goose.

This platform is not intended to replace existing enterprise solutions but to serve as a tangible demonstration of my end-to-end analytical process. It proves my ability to translate raw data into predictive intelligence that directly supports business objectives.

2. Core Intelligence Focus
Based on a thorough analysis of Canada Goose's SEC filings, this platform is focused on monitoring and mitigating two of the company's most acute and unique threat vectors:

Activist Threat to Supply Chain Integrity: Following the company's 2022 fur-free pivot, the activist threat has evolved. The platform models this shift, focusing on the new battleground: the ethics and security of the global down supply chain.

Geopolitical Risk in Key Markets: The system monitors for leading indicators of consumer backlash in the critical Greater China market, allowing for proactive brand posture adjustments in response to geopolitical tensions.

3. Key Features & Demonstrated Capabilities
This project directly demonstrates my ability to perform the core functions outlined in the job description:

Intelligence Analysis & Threat Monitoring:

The platform features a Predictive Indicators & Warnings (I&W) Tracker that moves beyond reactive alerts to provide early warning of developing crises.

It contains a Threat Actor Database profiling groups like LAV and PETA, tracking their TTPs and strategic objectives.

Travel Risk Management & Contingency Planning:

The Automated Travel Risk Brief Generator creates tailored briefs for any of the 74 global retail cities.

For high-risk travel (e.g., a sourcing manager visiting European suppliers), the system automatically inserts Counter-Surveillance Protocols and "sterile itinerary" recommendations to protect personnel and sensitive supply chain information.

Internal Communication:

The dashboard serves as a model for the clear, concise dissemination of intelligence to senior leadership, visually linking security threats to specific business assets and regions.
